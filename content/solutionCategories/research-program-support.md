Managing scientific data is challenging due to the variety of protocols for data collection and analysis and the vast range of parameters studied. As a further barrier, scientists lack shared, easy-to-use tools for data archiving, sharing, access, and reuse. We support collaborative science through a unified data management system.

We provide services for the complete data lifecycle, from research to archive. Many research groups, organizations, Integrated Ecosystem Monitoring Programs, and individual scientists are currently leveraging some or all of the components of our cyberinfrastructure for their data analysis, management, publication, or visualization needs and in pursuit of their larger research, monitoring, or decision-support goals.
