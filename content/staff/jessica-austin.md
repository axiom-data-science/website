Jessica's interests are in understanding and improving the efficiency of complex systems, whether that be a sprawling software infrastructure or a control system for robotic locomotion. She has a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Caltech and a master's in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon, as well as five years experience as a software developer and DevOps engineer at companies including ThoughtWorks and GrubHub.com. She joined Axiom to learn more about the management and analysis of scientific data at a large scale, and to work with scientists and engineers to more quickly gain insights into the data they collect. In the summer she enjoys foraging and gardening, in the winter you'll find her working on a project at the local Makerspace, and any time of year she can be found exploring the mountains around Anchorage with her dog, Kodiak.
