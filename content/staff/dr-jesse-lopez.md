Jesseâ€™s professional interests lie at the intersection of environmental science and computational science.  He studied History and Mathematics at the University of Washington (BA), Computational Mathematics at Brooklyn College (Post-Bac), and Environmental Science and Engineering at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU).  His doctoral work at OHSU was focused on developing and applying high-resolution numerical models and observations to study circulation and sediment dynamics in the Columbia River estuary. Jesse also has extensive experience teaching Mathematics and Computer Science from middle school, as a member of AmeriCorps, to upper-level undergraduate courses. Away from his laptop, Jesse enjoys listening to records and drinking tea with his orange cat.
