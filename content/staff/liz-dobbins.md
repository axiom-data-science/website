Liz received a Masters degree in Physical Oceanography from the University of Washington, Seattle, WA. Since then, she’s supported interdisciplinary scientific endeavors in wildly disparate ways - from Unix system administration to fieldwork north of the Arctic Circle. In 2009, Liz relocated with her family to Fairbanks, AK, where she has focused on processing data collected in Alaskan waters and creating near real-time web maps. More recently, she’s become intrigued by the philosophy of Reproducible Research and the open-source software that supports it. In her spare time, Liz can be found on the roads of Fairbanks, shuttling kids between ski teams and ballet lessons.
