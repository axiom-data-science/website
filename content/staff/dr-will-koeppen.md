Will has a Bachelor of Science degree from Juniata College (Geology and Physics, 2001); a Masters degree from Washington University in St. Louis (Earth and Planetary Science, 2003); and a PhD from the University of Hawaii at Manoa (Geology and Geophysics, 2008). His doctoral work included using laboratory analyses and satellite data to understand the composition and evolution of Mars. As a postdoc, he worked on a hybridized time-series analysis algorithm to detect volcanic eruptions in near-real time using real-time satellite data and methods to identify the presence of geologic materials associated with nuclear enrichment in thermal infrared airborne data. At Axiom, Will serves as staff scientist as well as a liaison to many of the scientific groups with which Axiom works.
