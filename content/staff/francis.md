As a puppy prodigy and adult dog phenom, Francis has dual degrees in Saliva Production and Getting in the Way. Before working at Axiom as an occupational therapist, Francis spent years learning the way of the dog in his owner's garage. He currently loves being off leash, corralling and giving rides to kids, barking at moose, and cleaning his plate.
