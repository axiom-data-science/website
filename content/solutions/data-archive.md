Using the Research Workspace, researchers can generate Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for final data products and publish to national data repositories.

Axiom’s data repository is a DataONE Generic Member Node, connected to the DataONE Network. As a DataCite member organization, Axiom is able to reserve and assign DOIs to all archived objects in the Research Workspace DataONE Member Node. In addition, a pipeline to NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) is under development.
