Reproducibility is fundamental to public trust in the scientific process. Preserving scripts used for data processing and analysis is important for leaving a legacy of reproducible, credible results.

The Research Workspace features a cloud-based Jupyter notebook integration to let users write numerical workflows and scripts from anywhere in the world that leverage their uploaded datasets. This allows computationally-intense scripts to be developed and run from any web-capable device, such as a laptop or Chromebook.

## Examples

* Axiom Data Science uses Jupyter Notebooks to calculate biodiversity indices from NOAA's Bering Arctic Subarctic Integrated Survey (BASIS) data, and compared it to sea surface temperatures from remote sensing and real-time stations.

* In support of SECOORA, we produced animations of wind, pressure, and precipitation accumulation forecasts for the Southeast United States during Hurricanes Florence and Michael.

* Axiom uses python and Jupyter extensively to generate reproducible workflows internally and externally.
