The Research Workspace is a web-based platform for collaboratively managing science projects through the entire data lifecycle. It allows research scientists, data managers, and program administrators a secure way to store and organize data within individual projects and research campaigns.

It is used to create, share, and execute reproducible numerical workflows; and to generate robust metadata in order to publish finalized data products to custom data catalogs and national data archives—all through a single application.

## Example Support

### NPRB Core Research Program
The North Pacific Research Board (NPRB) uses the Research Workspace to manage data collected as part of its Core Program. Their project data catalog represents over $70 million of funding across more than 400 projects and includes researchers from over 100 different national and international organizations.

### GulfWatch Alaska and Herring Research and Monitoring Programs
The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council’s GulfWatch Alaska and Herring Research and Monitoring program use the Research Workspace as a central platform to organize, document, and make data available for their use and for future use by the larger scientific community. Since 2012, over 21,000 data files and 450GB data have been shared among nearly 100 collaborators. Curated datasets are publicly-accessible available through a data portal, where they are discoverable among 300 additional GIS, environmental, numerical modeling and remote sensing data resources for the Gulf of Alaska. Ultimately, these datasets have been replicated in the DataONE archive for long-term preservation and discovery by broader scientific and management audiences.

### Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON)
The Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observing Network (AMBON) is a demonstration project of a national network to monitor biodiversity in the Arctic from microbes to whales. The Research Workspace is used store and share marine biodiversity data collected during Arctic cruises, and to transform data to Darwin Core for biological standardization across the network. Curated datasets are archived with NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) for public access.
