The Research Workspace is a web-based platform for collaboratively managing science projects through the entire data lifecycle. It allows research scientists, data managers, and program administrators a secure way to store and organize data within individual projects and research campaigns. 

It is used to create, share, and execute reproducible numerical workflows; and to generate robust metadata in order to publish finalized data products to custom data catalogs and national data archivesâ€”all through a single application.
