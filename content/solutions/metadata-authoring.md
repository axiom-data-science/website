The Research Workspace includes a tool to author metadata for scientific projects and datasets. As a cloud-based service, the metadata editor allows for metadata to be viewed and edited from any computer connected to the internet, and for more than one person to simultaneously review and edit metadata. In addition to field or themed-based entry forms, the editor includes a number of custom widgets to address common pain points. The editor exports ISO 19115 and 19110 standards metadata records.

## Features
The editor has the following time-saving features to reduce the tedium of metadata creation:
* a search-and-select tool for rapidly adding species information from the ~625,000 taxonomic entities in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS);
* a CSV file-reader for quickly adding data table headers from data tables;
* keyword selection tool from several common controlled vocabularies;
* tools to dynamically copy metadata content from small, thematic sections or from the entire record; and
* search tools for adding saved contact information from Research Workspace users.
